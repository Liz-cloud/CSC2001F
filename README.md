# CSC2001F_Assignements

## Assignment 1:
The goal of this assignment is to compare the Binary Search Tree with a traditional unsorted
array data structure, both implemented in Java, using a real-world application to read in and
provide access to Cape Town's load-shedding data.

## Assignment 2:
The goal of this assignment is to compare the AVL Tree with a Binary Search Tree, both
implemented in Java, using a real-world application to read in and provide access to Cape
Town's load shedding data. Using the requirements as specified in Assignment 1, but this time compare a BST to an AVL tree. Naturally, the names of applications and files will be different and the results from
the experiment should be different.
